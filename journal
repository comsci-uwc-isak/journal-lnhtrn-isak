First CS class in G12. It was very fun and more interactive than I thought. I got to review my old CS knowledge and realized I forgot some.
I'll review them later though.

We learnt about terminal. Coding with Terminal was very new and weird. It was really fun though. 
I got to half way of the exercise but I'll try to finish it later.
