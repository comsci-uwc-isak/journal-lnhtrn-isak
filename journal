First CS class in G12. It was very fun and more interactive than I thought. I got to review my old CS knowledge and realized I forgot some.
I'll review them later though.

We learnt about terminal. Coding with Terminal was very new and weird. It was really fun though. 
I got to half way of the exercise but I'll try to finish it later.

We learnt networking and tried Rasberry Pi. It was very fun jumping around and reading other people's file.

We experiment with pug, stylus and coffeescript. 
I made my first webpage today and it's running fine. I experiment a lot with colors and fonts and the overall design.
I'm trying to work on moving the navigation bar to the top.
